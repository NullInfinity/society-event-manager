# socman

socman is a society membership and attendance tracking library for Python,
which tracks members in a SQLite3 database.

### Planned Features
At present the main goal is to stabilise current functionality and refactor
existing code. Major targets for version 0.2 are:

* use py.test for testing
* support OSX and Windows for automated testing
* simplify logic in MemberDatabase
* publish the library on PyPI

Longer term goals (for inclusion by version 1.0) include:

* tracking event metadata in text files
* CLI and GUI frontends with support for custom society branding

## Installation

This library is in development. Clone the repository if you want to try it. With version 0.2
the library will be made available via PyPI.
