* socman is a society membership and attendance tracking library for Python

* There will also be CLI and GUI frontends with support for custom society branding

* I created this software as IT secretary for the [Oxford Invariants Mathematical Society](http://invariants.org.uk/) in order to record and verify membership status

* Licensed under the MIT licence (see LICENSE.txt).
